        <p class="mainParagraph">Have you ever felt upset while scrolling through your Instagram feed, your Twitter timeline, or your TikTok "For You" page? These sites and many other social media platforms use methods to allow dopamine to be released from your brain, causing the positive feeling you get by interacting with your friends online. But constantly using these addicting apps can seriously affect your mental health.</p>
        <p class="mainParagraph">Did you know that 81% of teenagers in the United States use some form of social media? This may seem normal and predictable, but it also means that all of these young people are likely to develop mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. Certainly, social media does not always cause dangerous effects, but too much unmonitored consumption of negative content, which is unavoidable on the Internet, can create serious issues that you may not notice right away.</p>

        <h1 id="subTitle">Overview</h1>
        <p id="subParagraph">If you started using social media at a young age (i.e. under 13 years old), these sites are more likely to affect your mental and emotional health. Social media platforms allow for the ability to filter photos to appear different than one's actual looks. This can cause unnecessary but dangerous comparisons that young people make, causing them to believe something that is not true about others and think that they have to change themselves. These methods, such as the use of filters, makes it difficult to understand and recognize the difference between what is real and what is altered. When people start to compare themselves at such a young age, it can cause damage to their self-esteem and confidence, making it more likely to develop a mental illness, such as anxiety, depression, or an eating disorder.</p>
        <p id="subParagraph">There are ways to recognize this problem before it gets worse for somebody. If you or somebody you know experiences any of the feelings and symptoms found on our Resources page, there are methods in which you can reach out for help from a professional. If you want to create change in the way these platforms cause many issues for the public, take a look at the organizations we have listed on our Resources page, as well. </p>
